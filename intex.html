    <h1>To My Dearest Fuggan 🕊️</h1>
    <p>
      Arushi, my sweet Aru, my Fuggan... I don’t even know how to begin this letter, because putting into words what you mean to me feels like trying to capture the sky in a jar. But I’ll try. Because you deserve every word, every feeling, every heartbeat that this letter carries.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the very first time we spoke on 15 April, I felt something shift inside me. There was a strange comfort in your voice, a softness in your words that felt like home. I remember the way I couldn’t stop smiling after our first call — like something rare had just entered my life. And then, by the 17th, it was no longer a feeling... it was a truth. I loved you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loving you has been the most honest thing I’ve ever done. It’s like breathing — unconscious, essential, effortless. You call me Nishu, and every time I hear that name in your voice, my heart melts. That name feels like it belongs to someone lucky, someone chosen — and that someone is me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve laughed, we’ve fought, we’ve cried. We’ve been silly, stubborn, silent, and soft. And yet, every phase, every emotion, every flaw — we carried it together. We didn’t run from the ugly parts. We stayed. We grew. And that’s love, isn’t it? Real love isn’t perfect. It’s patient. It listens. It forgives. And you’ve taught me all of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are nights I lie awake thinking about how far we’ve come. From strangers to soulmates. From “Hi” to “I can’t live without you.” And I promise you, Fuggan, this isn’t just a phase. You’re not just a moment in my life — you are my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve seen you happy, I’ve seen you tired, I’ve seen you mad, and I’ve seen you broken. And through it all, I’ve fallen more in love with your soul. You’re not just beautiful on the outside — you’re beautiful in your anger, your overthinking, your deep love, and your little tantrums. I adore every version of you. Even the dramatic one 😅
    </p>
    <p>
      I know sometimes I mess up. I know I’ve hurt you unintentionally. I’m sorry for every moment that made your heart feel heavy. But I also want you to know — I never took your love for granted. Every “I love you” from you is like a prayer answered. Every second you stay with me is a blessing I whisper thank you for.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think about our future a lot. Waking up next to you. Fighting over who gets the blanket. Cooking together (or ordering because we’re lazy 😜). Holding your hand during drives. Hugging you when you’ve had a rough day. Celebrating your small wins. Raising a home filled with laughter, comfort, and peace. That’s what I dream of.
    </p>
    <p>
      People wait a lifetime to find what I found in you. I don’t want fancy dates or cinematic love stories. I want us. The raw, the messy, the real. I want your sleepy voice in the morning. Your overthinking rants at midnight. Your smile when you see me on video call. That’s the heaven I want to live in.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, Arushi, are the softness in my storm. The calm in my chaos. The home I never knew I needed. And no matter what the world throws at us, I promise I’ll choose you — every single time. Even on the hard days. Especially on the hard days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for choosing me. For loving me. For staying even when it wasn’t easy. I don’t know how this world gave me someone like you — but I promise, with every breath in me, I’ll protect your heart and hold your hand till the end of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forever yours,<br/>
      <strong>Nishu 💗</strong>
